## Mod 4 Deliverables:

### Practice Interview

I did a practice whiteboarding interview session with Brittany during Mod4. I was surprised at how difficult it was, and how much I over-thought things. It was a great reminder to slow down, ask questions, and do something simple that works, instead of something complex that doesn't function. She also gave me some great advice on whiteboarding syntax that I will use in the future.

Moving forward, I'd like to do a full mock interview to refine my skills, and I have someone I think will be able to help me with that.

## Julian Kyer Module 4 Action Plan 

### Module 4 Goals
By the end of module 4, I would like to have a job offer, have a familiarity with back-end engineering, and be comfortable stepping into a junior developer position.

#### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
* Attend 4 meet-ups
* Post projects on GH pages
* Refine LinkedIn and resume
* Talk to Ingrid, Adam, Josh
* Make list of companies in area and research them
* Apply and start interviewing by second week of mod 4

##### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
In addition to regular projects, keep fundamentals sharp with Iron FE, polish the parts of past projects that I wasn't satisfied with.
##### Opportunities Research:
I will attend meet-ups, talk to friends in the industry, and research online as a "last-resort."
##### Cold Outreach/Network:
I've spoken to my mentor, who said it's better to start early. I also have a couple friends in the industry available as resources, listed above.

I should also talk to the people at the Corner Boxing Club who are participating in FounderFights with me for networking.
##### Personal Branding *(A personal branding section is optional)*:
I think my personal brand has a compelling story, and will be helpful to pull on. Being a professional athlete for a decade communicates a lot of valuable things to an employer, as well as my work as an artist.
#### Timeline:
* Start attending meetups, build portfolio now
* Refactor and publish projects over intermission
* Reach out to contacts at end of mod3
* Iron FE and interview prep starting over intermission

##### Weekly Tasks:
* Job search Sundays, Wednesdays
* IronFE 2x week
* Saturday afternoon portfolio work
* Find meet-ups that don't conflict with sparring
#### What I Will Work on with Meg
Finding companies that would be a good fit, how to reach out, resume review.
